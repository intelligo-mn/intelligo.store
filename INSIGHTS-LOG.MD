#### Eliminate render-blocking JavaScript and CSS in above-the-fold content
Your page has 1 blocking CSS resources. This causes a delay in rendering your page.

Leverage browser caching for the following cacheable resources:
```
http://platform.instagram.com/en_US/embeds.js (20 minutes)
```

### Minify JavaScript

Compacting JavaScript code can save many bytes of data and speed up downloading, parsing, and execution time.
Minify JavaScript for the following resources to reduce their size by 4KiB (29% reduction).

```
Minifying http://www.shop.bella.mn/js/lib/angucomplete-alt.js could save 1.5KiB (26% reduction) after compression.
Minifying http://www.shop.bella.mn/js/app.js could save 1.4KiB (32% reduction) after compression.
Minifying http://www.shop.bella.mn/js/lib/xtForms/xtForm.js could save 1.1KiB (30% reduction) after compression.
```
### Minify HTML
Compacting HTML code, including any inline JavaScript and CSS contained in it, can save many bytes of data and speed up download and parse times.
```
Minify HTML for the following resources to reduce their size by 1.8KiB (17% reduction).
Minifying http://www.shop.bella.mn/ could save 1.3KiB (16% reduction) after compression.
