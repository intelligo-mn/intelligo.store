### Privacy

The operator of this website takes the protection of your personal data very seriously. We treat your personal data confidentially and in accordance with the data protection regulations and this privacy policy.

The use of our website is generally possible without providing personal data. As far as on our sides personal data (for example name, address or e-mail addresses) are collected, this takes place, as far as possible, on voluntary basis. This data will not be passed on to third parties without your explicit consent.

We would like to point out that data transmission over the Internet (e.g. communication by e-mail) can have security gaps. A complete protection of data against access by third parties is not possible.

### Newsletter

If you would like to subscribe to the newsletter offered on the website, we require an e-mail address from you as well as information that allows us to verify that you are the owner of the e-mail address provided and that you agree to receive the newsletter. Further data will not be collected. We use this data exclusively for the dispatch of the requested information and do not pass them on to third parties.

You can revoke your consent to the storage of the data, the e-mail address and its use for sending the newsletter at any time, for example via the “unsubscribe” link in the newsletter.

### SSL encryption

This site uses SSL encryption for security reasons and to protect the transmission of confidential content, such as requests you send to us as a site operator. You can recognize an encrypted connection by the fact that the address line of the browser changes from “http://” to “https://” and by the lock symbol in your browser line.

If SSL encryption is activated, the data you transmit to us cannot be read by third parties.

## Simple Analytics

To get critical information about the behavior of our visitors, we use [Simple Analytics](https://simpleanalytics.com). This analytics software gives us insight about our visitors only in general, but not about individuals per say, as it does not track visitors and does not store any personal identifiable information. [Go to their documentation](https://docs.simpleanalytics.com/what-we-collect) to find out what Simple Analytics collects (and most importantly what they don't).
